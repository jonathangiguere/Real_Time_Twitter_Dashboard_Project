    "# Real Time Tweet Analysis & Dashboarding Tool (1/2)\n",
    "## Project Motivation\n",
    "Originally, my idea for this project was to stream tweets about the Washington Redskins, analyze their polarity scores, and visualize the overall negative/positive sentiment towards the team in real time.  As I learned more about Python's Tweepy library, I realized that it would be easy to analyze any word a user wanted.  Although I could simply set 'Redskins' as the tracked word, I thought it would be a better idea to allow the user to specify the input.  Once specified, Tweepy will start to stream tweets containing the tracked word.  The streamed tweets will then be cleaned and various aspects will be displayed on a dashboard that can be updated to get real time data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use the Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "First, go to https://developer.twitter.com/en/account/get-started to access your Twitter application's keys.  Before running this notebook, these keys need to be pasted into the cell below titled \"Connection to Twitter API\".  If you do not already have a Twitter Developer account or app, feel free to set up an account.  Once you have an account and an app created, you can access the keys you need to run this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has two jupyter notebooks that work together.  If you run all cells in this notebook, 'DATS 6103 - Project 3 Streaming', you will be prompted to enter a tracked word to analyze.  Once a tracked word is entered, this notebook will stream tweets containing the tracked word, and write them to a .csv file called 'OutputStreaming.csv'.  After choosing your word, you can scroll to the bottom to see the tweets being streamed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running all cells in the second notebook, 'DATS 6103 - Project 3 Analysis.ipynb' reads the .csv file into a dataframe and performs the analysis.  The end of this second file gives a dashboard showing real time information about Tweets containing the tracked word.  One can keep running all cells in the 'DATS 6103 - Project 3 Analysis.ipynb' notebook to update the dashboard as new Tweets are constantly being streamed from this notebook."
